README:

I have a makefile in the directory
type 'make' to compile

I also have an input file called disk.ima

I have 4 files:

DISK INFO:

Run: ./diskinfo disk.ima

Disk info outputs:
OS Name
Label of the Disk
Total size of the disk
Free size of the disk
Number of files in the root directory
Number of FAT copies
Sectors per FAT


DISK LIST:

Run: ./disklist disk.ima

Disk list outputs:
F or D for whether the file is a file(F) or directory(D)
The file size
The file name
The file date and the file time


DISK GET:

Run: ./diskget disk.ima ICEBERGS.TEX (or ANS1.PDF or REMINDER.TXT)

outputs file not found if cannot find file

Disk list produces a file in your directory that it gets from disk.ima



DISK PUT:

Run: ./diskput disk.ima foo.txt (or whichever file you would like to put in)

Disk put puts a file into disk.ima and updates the disk accordingly
